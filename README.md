## Themed templates

There are 6 ready-to-use templates for different fields, each with a distinct look:

| Template | Field | Theme |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `template-cs.html` | Computer Science / SWE | Dark · neon green · monospace |
| `template-design.html` | Design / UX / Creative Arts | Warm cream · bold coral · editorial serif |
| `template-data.html` | Data Science / ML | Deep navy · electric teal · dot-grid |

| `template-arch.html` | Architecture / Civil / Urban Design | Stark Bauhaus · construction red · bold type |

Open `templates/index.html` to preview all six side by side, or click directly into any template file.

To use a template as your main page, copy its contents into `index.html` and replace the placeholder text.

## Getting started

**New to GitHub?** Read [`HOSTING_GUIDE.md`](HOSTING_GUIDE.md) first — it walks through everything from creating an account to adding photos and going live.

Quick version if you already know the basics:

1. **Fork** this repo (button top-right on GitHub).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → main branch / root** and hit save.
3. Your site goes live at `https://your-username.github.io/undergrad-eportfolio-tutorial/` in about a minute.
4. Edit the files and replace the placeholder text.

## Changing the colour scheme

At the top of `css/style.css` there are four variables. Change them and every button, link, and highlight on every page updates.

```css
:root {
  --accent:      #2563eb;   /* main colour */
  --accent-dark: #1d4ed8;   /* hover state */
  --bg:          #f8fafc;   /* page background */
  --surface:     #ffffff;   /* card background */
}
```

## Customisation checklist

Work through this after you fork:

- [ ] Replace `Your Name` everywhere
- [ ] Add your photo in `index.html` (or remove the placeholder)
- [ ] Put your real projects in `projects.html`
- [ ] Fix the skill percentages in `skills.html`
- [ ] Add your actual education and experience in `resume.html`
- [ ] Update GitHub, LinkedIn, and email links in `contact.html`
- [ ] Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), get a form ID, and paste it into `contact.html`
- [ ] Add a real `resume.pdf` and link it in `resume.html`
- [ ] Pick a colour — change `--accent` in `style.css`

## Why no JavaScript?

The mobile nav, progress bar animations, and hover effects all work with CSS only. This keeps the template simple to understand and edit — no node_modules to install, no build step to break, works offline. If you want to add JS later, `AI_PROMPTS.md` has prompts for scroll progress bars, copy buttons, and project filters.

## Regenerating the QR code

If you rename the repo, update the URL in `generate_qr.py` then run:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
python generate_qr.py
git add qr-code.png && git commit -m "update qr code"
```
